# Features in Insights Copilot

## Chat
The core of Insights Copilot is its chat-based interface, enabling users to ask business questions in natural language and receive instant, data-driven responses. Insights Copilot can interpret follow-ups based on prior exchanges, making iterative exploration easy and natural. Response formats include summaries, tables, and charts (where supported), and users can clarify or refine questions seamlessly.

## In-Chat Actions (Feedback, Regenerate, Share, Copy, View Sources, Tables, Charts)
- **Feedback**: Instantly provide thumbs up/down and add comments for every response, feeding into product improvement and training.
- **Regenerate**: Request Insights Copilot to re-run or revise an answer using alternate logic or data without retyping your original question.
- **Share**: Share insights or chat segments with colleagues via secure links or export, supporting collaboration and knowledge transfer.
- **Copy**: Copy results, tables, or summaries to clipboard for use in emails, presentations, or external reports.
- **View Sources**: Inspect data sources or documentation supporting a given answer for trust and compliance.
- **Tables & Charts (WIP)**: Insights Copilot is piloting advanced data visualization directly within chat, allowing users to render and interact with tables and charts as part of their analytical workflow. Stay tuned for broader rollout.

## Smartflows
Smartflows are guided, step-by-step analytical journeys designed to streamline common workflows and repetitive processes. They break down complex business analyses into manageable, interactive tasks. Each step presents options, explanations, or prompted data entry, making it easy for any user to arrive at actionable insights, even without deep technical knowledge. Smartflows also enforce process consistency and support best-practice reporting formats.

## Chat History
Everything you discuss with Insights Copilot is automatically stored in your chat history, allowing you to revisit, review, and build upon previous conversations. Chats are organized by date and use case context. This enables quick retrieval of past insights, supports regulatory and audit requirements, and helps new users learn from prior successful queries.

## Know Your Data
The "Know Your Data" feature gives users transparency into the underlying datasets powering Insights Copilot's responses. At any time, you can inspect the source, freshness, and lineage of data used in your analysis. This builds trust in Insights Copilot outputs and supports data governance objectives by providing context, definitions, and direct access to data dictionaries or relevant business glossaries.

## Use Case Switch
With a single click, users can switch between different configured use cases (e.g., Marketing, Supply Chain, Procurement). The conversation context and analysis options automatically adjust to the selected domain. This flexibility helps users access relevant data, templates, and workflows without additional logins or navigation complexity, ensuring security and minimizing manual configuration errors.

## User Settings
The user settings panel allows for preferences and customization. Users can manage their display language (English, Spanish, Portuguese), notification preferences, and analytics/reporting defaults. Soon, it will also support interface personalization and accessibility options, helping users tailor Insights Copilot to their work style or business priorities.
