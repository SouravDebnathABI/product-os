What is Management Syatem?
Management System is a structured framework that provides the fundamentals for sustaining and improving organizational results. It includes training in various methodologies such as SDCA (Standardize-Do-Check-Act), PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act), and encompasses all Management Systems like VPO, SMS, DPO, LCP, and ProMS. The system is designed to be applicable at all levels of the organization and involves regular training, both for new hires and as annual refreshers, to close execution gaps or introduce new concepts and processes. The Management System connects strategic plans to shopfloor execution through a cascading process involving business descriptions, process maps, SWOT analysis, KPI dashboards, routine and performance review processes, and a suite of management tools. It ensures alignment, standardization, and continuous improvement across the organization, integrating leadership, method, and knowledge to optimize efficiency and achieve strategic goals
