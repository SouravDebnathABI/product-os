# User Research & Insights

## Top User Pain Points

### Low retention and users leaving after few questions (Most Frequent)
**~80% of users drop within a week**

Users either ask few questions and leave because they feel it can only handle limited questions or are not happy with the first response. This is the most frequently reported pain point.

### Cannot have natural conversations
Some users have reported that Insights Copilot cannot have a natural conversation with users and sticks to responses it is trained to provide.

### Cannot handle conversations about unknown topics
Insights Copilot cannot handle conversations about things it does not know or cannot answer to.

### Lacks self-awareness of capabilities
Insights Copilot does not have knowledge about its own capabilities.

### Poor follow-up responses losing context
Users have reported poor follow up responses losing context.

### Chart visualizations not useful
Users do not find the chart visualizations useful.

## Feature Requests

**Most Requested:**
- **Confusion with Use Case switch** - As a user with access to multiple use cases in IC, I need to intuitively know which use case I need to be asking questions in without confusion or ambiguity
- **Simplified onboarding** - Highest drop off in user adoption funnel ~60%
- **Export to PPT option** - Since most smart flow responses are used as a PowerPoint artefact in the user journey's end
- **More nuanced and detailed summarizations and recommendations**
- **Better context retention for follow-ups**
- **Improved Citations and guardrails against hallucinations** - Redesign needed for dataset references since business users only related to Power BI dashboard or higher level information like Revenue data instead of underlying multiple tables
- **Reduced latency** - Currently 30-60 seconds

## Behavioral Patterns

Usage patterns are fairly similar across use cases:

1. **Most users (~80%) casually try Insights Copilot once and never return**
2. **Power users from Marketing Strategy & Insights use cases come back once every quarter (~20% retention)** since their data is updated quarterly, while others have consistent monthly decline to a stagnant 20% retention

More behavior data shall be provided later on further analysis from Mixpanel.

### User Quotes

**Positive:**
> "Very interesting data given umprompted which increases the alcohol industry knowledge just by entering the tool"
