# Company Strategy

## Current Goals

**2026 Roadmap:**
- **Q1 2026**: Conversational AI - handle natural human-like conversations with long follow-ups and context retention
- **Q2 2026**: Memory - handle user preferences and business knowledge base to improve responses
- **Q1 to Q4 2026**: Product Integrations - integrate Insights Copilot into existing business applications for higher reach and adoption

## Key Metrics to Move
- **NPS**: From ~0 (currently negative or close to zero) → Target 50+
- **MAU**: From 200 → Target 500+ (by retaining them with more useful interactions with longer conversations)
- **Activated users**: From 5K → Target 10K+ (with integrations)

## Competitive Pressures & Market Context

The notable pressures are in conversational abilities:

**Perception & Investment:**
- Has not convinced key investors since it feels highly limited in its capabilities compared to public products like ChatGPT Enterprise which CXOs of the company have access to

**User Retention Issues:**
Users struggle to find consistent usage - they either ask few questions and leave because they feel it can only handle limited questions or are not happy with the first response. This could be because:
- Cannot have a natural conversation with users and sticks to responses it is trained to provide
- Cannot handle conversations about things it does not know or cannot answer to
- Does not have knowledge about its own capabilities
- Lacks memory at a user or organizational level that can grow and improve with time

**Competitive Threats:**
- Competitive pressure from AI capabilities in existing products used inside AB InBev. For example, Databricks offering Genie as a free add-on to Unity Catalog

**Market Shifts:**
- Market shifts related to agentic workflows and reasoning models are one of the key asks coming from stakeholders and users

## Strategic Priorities

**We are saying YES to:**
- **Immediate priority**: Buy-in from key investors - CTO of the company to keep funding the product and also other CXOs to start charging back from the individual departments (marketing, supply chain, etc.)
- **Long-term priority**: Organic user growth through product integration

## Constraints & Limitations

**Tech Debt:**
- Experimenting with React framework for agentic workflow execution and setting up robust LLM evals before making the switch
- Pressure to deploy improved conversational AI by end of Q1 AND make first integration with modified APIs with Marketing as priority

**Team Size:**
- 2 Product Managers
- 1 Scrum Master
- 1 UX Designer
- 1 Backend engineer
- 1 Frontend engineer
- 1 Full stack engineer
- 1 Data engineer
- 1 Tester
- 5 ML Engineers

This limits parallel execution with robust testing. The extended teams of use case developers have limited testing and low product tech understanding.

**Budget:**
- Yet to be decided but will be reduced from previous years' budget ($1.5M)

**Costs:**
- Costs are expected to increase since agents would possibly augment input and output tokens due to iterations with trial and error

**Data Quality:**
- Always a constraint in every use case since they lack clean data with extensive data dictionary and no resources or lack of understanding to clean data
